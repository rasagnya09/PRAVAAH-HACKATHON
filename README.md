# PRAVAAH-HACKATHON
This repository contains two interconnected applications designed to facilitate communication between sign language users and non-sign language users. The first application focuses on recognizing hand gestures and converting them to text or speech, while the second application takes text input and converts it to gestures in Indian Sign Language (ISL).
# HANDGESTURE RECOGNITION<br />
  Features of HandGesture Recognition part:<br />
    -- Real-time hand gesture recognition <br />
    -- Translation of gestures into text<br />
    -- Option to convert text to speech<br />
    -- User-friendly interface for ease of use<br />
  Our first technology, found in the "hand gesture" folder, focuses on gesture recognition. The "Main.py" file within this folder contains the executable Python 
  script. Utilizing technologies such as cv2, playsound, and gtts, this application recognizes gestures made by the user through a camera interface and converts 
  them into text and sound. This enables mute individuals to communicate more effectively by translating their sign language gestures into spoken words.<br />

# TEXT TO SIGN CONVERSION<br />
  Features of HandGesture Recognition part:<br />
    -- Text input for translation<br />
    -- Visual display of corresponding ISL gestures<br />
    -- Interactive and educational tool for learning ISL<br />
  The second technology, located in the "sign language" folder, is designed for text-to-sign conversion. The "grid2.py" file within this folder contains the 
  executable Python script.This application takes text as input and converts it into Indian Sign Language, making it easier for deaf individuals to understand 
  spoken or written communication. By translating text into sign language gestures, this tool empowers deaf users to engage in conversations and interactions 
  more seamlessly.
